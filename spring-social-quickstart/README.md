Spring Social Quickstart
========================
This sample is designed to get you up and running quickly.
See the walkthrough at: https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social/wiki/Quick-Start

To run, simply import the project into your IDE and deploy to a Servlet 2.5 or > container such as Tomcat 6 or 7.
Access the project at http://localhost:8080/spring-social-quickstart

Alternatively, you can run the application using Gradle. 

To make it easier to build the project with Gradle, the Gradle wrapper has been included. The Gradle wrapper makes it possible to run Gradle without having to explicitly install Gradle to your system.

To run the application with Gradle:

```sh
$ gradlew tomcatRun
```
