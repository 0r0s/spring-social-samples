- spring-social-showcase, illustrating most of the features.
- spring-social-extending-new-api, showing how to extend the framework to implement a new ServiceProvider + API binding.
- spring-social-extending-existing-api, showing how to extend the framework and re-use an existing API binding (also shows XML-centric configuration and is Spring Framework 3.0.x compatible).
