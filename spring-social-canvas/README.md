Spring Social Canvas
====================
This sample app demonstrates how to use Spring Social within a Facebook Canvas application.

To run, import the project into your IDE and deploy to a Servlet 2.5 or > container such as Tomcat 6 or 7. The container should also be able to serve the application over HTTPS.

Access the application via Facebook at http://apps.facebook.com/springsocialcanvas. This is the canvas page configured in Facebook for the Spring Social Canvas sample.

The pertinent details of the application's Facebook configuration is as follows:
 - __Display Name__: Spring Social Canvas
 - __Namespace__: springsocialcanvas
 - __Canvas Page__: http://apps.facebook.com/springsocialcanvas
 - __Canvas URL__: http://localhost:8080/spring-social-canvas/canvas/
 - __Secure Canvas URL__: https://localhost:8080/spring-social-canvas/canvas/
